== Encryption Model
Models:
- CryptUtils
- CryptAES

== Requirements
Our Encryption tools must have the following data:
- Encryption key(s) 
- Password Salt (possibly also the password?)
- Encrypted ciphertext


With our models we must be able to do the following on our client's end:
- Encrypt our data in AES-256 GCM format.
- Decrypt our data
- Encode our data in base64
- Store our keys, salt (In member vars and possibly to keystore).

- Securely generate random keys
- Securely generate AES keys
- Securely generate RSA keys too maybe, might be useful
- Securely generate random salt
- Securely generate random passwords
We need to do an awful lot of random stuff here, maybe make a random class?

- Test for proper padding, and block sizes if that isn't handled by lib.

- Do a test with a bit of php just to see if it will be properly handled by it

- Test with mocks and php frontend later -> for server later
- Test with mocks in java application -> for client


- Possibly encrypt files

*To Be Implemented*

*To Be Considered*
- Client side certificate validation 
- Merge CryptUtils with CryptAES? 

== TODO

== Discussion
- Wrap data up in .json format for easy access?
- Send data as base64 file? Most likely as we'll need to temporarily save it, or perhaps just use java listener

== Possible Features
SSL Configuration for key and data transmission.

=== Priority Features
