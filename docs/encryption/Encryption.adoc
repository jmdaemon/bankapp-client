== Encryption Model
Models:
- CryptUtils
- CryptAES

== Requirements
Our Encryption tools must have the following data:
- Encryption key(s) 
- Password Salt (possibly also the password?)
- Encrypted ciphertext


With our models we must be able to do the following on our client's end:
- Encrypt our data in AES-256 GCM format.
- Decrypt our data
- Encode our data in base64
- Store our keys, salt

*To Be Implemented*

*To Be Considered*
- Client side certificate validation 
- Merge CryptUtils with CryptAES? 

== TODO

== Discussion
- Wrap data up in .json format for easy access?
- Send data as base64 file? Most likely as we'll need to temporarily save it, or perhaps just use java listener

== Possible Features
SSL Configuration for key and data transmission.

=== Priority Features
